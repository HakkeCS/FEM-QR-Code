## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

I used this project to get a bit more familiar with TailwindCSS and how it works. This helped me solidify the initiation process with Tailwind and getting the configuration correct.

### Continued development

I will continue to work on customizing the tailwind.config.js file to make more personalized style choices.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Official Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This is really an invaluable resource when using Tailwind.
